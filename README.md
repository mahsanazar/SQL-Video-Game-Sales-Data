# Video Game Sales and Reviews Analysis

## Overview
The **Video Game Sales and Reviews Analysis** project explores trends in the video game industry from 1977 to 2020. The dataset used contains information on the top 400 best-selling video games during this period, including sales figures, critic reviews, and user scores. This project aims to investigate whether video game quality, as perceived by critics and users, has evolved over time amidst the growing market.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from VGChartz and supplemented with additional data from Metacritic. It includes details on over 13,000 video games, but for the purpose of this analysis, we've focused on the top 400 best-selling games. The dataset covers a wide range of attributes for each game, such as:
- Title
- Platform
- Year of release
- Genre
- Publisher
- Global sales figures
- Critic scores
- User scores

The dataset allows us to compare the commercial success of games with their critical reception, providing insights into whether highly sold games tend to also be highly rated.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to investigate the hypothesis surrounding the quality of video games over time. With the gaming industry projected to exceed $300 billion by 2027, understanding trends in game quality is crucial. By analyzing the relationship between sales performance and critical/user reception, we aim to answer the question: Are video games improving, or has the golden age already passed?

## Methodology
The analysis involves SQL queries on the dataset to:
1. Explore the distribution of game sales across different platforms and genres.
2. Compare average critic scores versus user scores.
3. Identify trends in game releases and sales over different decades.
4. Examine whether there is a correlation between sales figures and review scores.

## Future Directions
Future iterations of this project could involve:
- Utilizing machine learning models to predict game success based on available attributes.
- Incorporating sentiment analysis on user reviews to gauge emotional responses towards games.
- Examining regional differences in game preferences and sales patterns.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into the dynamics of the video game industry over the past decades. By leveraging data on sales and reviews, we hope to contribute to discussions on the evolving nature of video game quality and its implications for both developers and consumers.
